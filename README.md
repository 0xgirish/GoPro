## GoPro
This extension is mainly for my personal use but others are welcome to use it as well.
The main purpose of this extension is to provide competitive programming snippet for golang.
You may be thinking who do competitive programming in golang. Well I do ;)

## Availiable snippet
    - gopro - basic starter file with buffered printf and scanf with testcase loop.
    - goset - set data-structure in golang.
    - gostack - stack data-structure.
    - goqueue - queue data-structure.
    - gograph - graph data-structure snippet(required set data-structure e.g. goset).
    - gofs - bfs(or dfs) algorithm snippet(required graph and queue(or stack) snippet).

## Running the Sample

- When you type `goset` in a golang file, you would see the snippet for set data-structure.
